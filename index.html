<h4>Througout my post highschool education Ive struggled to find a passion of mine that aligned with my values and goals in life. After searching diffrent career paths I was introduced to technology and have not looked back since. With the near infinite possibilites the technology industry provides I believe it is the perfect match. With my desire to learn, create, problem solve, and impact a long with meeting diverse and like minded people I feel this is where I need to be.<br>
The Year Up program has allowed me an opportunity to get my foot into the industry while helping me acquire and enhance the neccessary skills to be successful. Prior to attending the program I have had no prior experience in coding. Since attending I have established a foundation in HTML and CSS and have worked on numerous projects independenlty and with peers to apply my knowledge.<br>
My goals include sharpeing my codeing skills in HTML and CSS, branch out into other languages while building my portfolio to show off my development.</h4>
